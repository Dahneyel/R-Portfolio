My first R project analyses the results of web scraping of LinkedInâ€™s job postings in the data
engineering field. 

The main research questions are;
1. What are the most common job titles and emerging roles in the data engineering field?
2. What countries have the most data engineering job opportunities?
3. What are the most in-demand skills for data engineering positions?

The importance of this project is to give entry level and mid-level career professionals
insights into the relevant skills and opportunities in the data engineering field for those
considering a career as a data engineer. It is also important to know which countries have the
most opportunities in the data engineering field. In the future, further analysis may be done to
explore the salaries for several data engineering positions and the career prospects for those
looking to transition into another field from data engineering, and vice versa, with other
supporting datasets.

This analysis is very interesting for job seekers like myself and other professionals who need
relevant insights to inform their career decisions.
